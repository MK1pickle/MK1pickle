-Hi Im a Data Communications Eng, 

I work for a telco on undersea fiber optics, on satellite communications, basically backhaul of Internet traffic. 

Im a ham, and have been for 30 years. 

Im not really a programmer, but I like helping get things to the last mile to speak. Im great at testing equipment and setting up real world test scenarios and test plans.

Im also pretty good at documentation, as I have brought several projects from beta tier product to production- as the customer.

Specifically I am interested in building an SDR TX RX/ WInlink VARA data modem thats ruggedized and all in one hardened aluminum enclosure.

Im good with Cad. I can solder, and i have used a lot of different equipment in the field so I know how things break...

Have a great day!
